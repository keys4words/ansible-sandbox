Write a playbook /home/thor/playbooks/configure_webserver.yml which installs nginx web server and serves a html file: index.html from directory /usr/share/nginx/html on remote servers.

You are provided with /home/thor/playbooks/index.html that you should copy to remote web servers listed on inventory /home/thor/playbooks/inventory. Ensure that nginx is serving the file, that you copied.
